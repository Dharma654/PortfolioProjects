# Pulling data through Pandas:



import pandas as pd


data = pd.read_csv("movies.csv")


# print(type(data["rating"]))

# # Checking through all the data where Rating = R
data_rating = data[data["rating"] == "R"]
print(data_rating)


# # Checking the nos. of R Rating
data_budget_count = len(data[data["rating"] == "R"])
print(data_budget_count)
#
#
# # Checking max budget from the whole data
budget_data = data[data["budget"] == data.budget.max()]


# # Getting the max runtime from all of the movies:
print(data[data.runtime == data.runtime.max()])


# # getting the min runtime from all of the movies:
print(data[data.runtime == data.runtime.min()])


#############################################
drama_genre = data[data["genre"] == "Drama"]
print(drama_genre)

# # Getting the movies of year 2005
yr_count = data[data["year"] == "2005"]
print(yr_count)


# Getting the whole list of countries:
print(data['country'])


# Getting all the name of the movies from line 16 - 24  and their year of release :
print(data.loc['Dressed to Kill' : 'The Final Countdown', 'year'])

# anotherway of doing the same thing :
print(data.iloc[14:23,[3,4]])


#  Now lets say we dont want to see a particular column in this case, director & writer as in visualizing the data where the data will be immutable:
data.drop(['director', 'writer'] , axis=1)


# Lets say we want to see only first 15 rows of data:
print(data.head(15))

# Same works with if we want to see  last 10 rows of data:
print(data.tail(10))
